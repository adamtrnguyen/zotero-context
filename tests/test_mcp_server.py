"""Tests for the MCP adapter.

WHAT THESE ASSERT, AND WHY IT IS MOSTLY STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------------
The adapter implements no verb of its own -- every tool calls the same function a
Python consumer calls -- so testing that a trash works would re-test `test_writes.py`.
What is genuinely new and genuinely fragile is the SCHEMA: 17 declarations that have to
keep agreeing with 17 signatures, in a file where a typo produces a tool that fails only
when an agent reaches for it. So most of these are properties over `TOOLS`.

Three of them encode requirements that would be silent if broken:

  * every declared property is a real parameter of the verb (a typo'd `item_keys` would
    otherwise reach `TypeError` at call time, in front of an agent)
  * no tool declares `store`, `linker`, `cookjohn` or `journal_dir` -- the first three
    would let a caller aim the write path at an arbitrary URL, and `test_crud.py`
    already asserts the same property of the Python signatures
  * no schema ships `force` defaulted to True, and every verb that HAS a force gate
    exposes it -- defaulting it would silently defeat the gates, and omitting it would
    make those verbs permanently unusable through MCP

WHERE THESE MOCK
----------------
At the transports and the database, which is the same boundary `conftest.py` uses. The
tool call path deliberately has no `store`/`linker`/`cookjohn` parameter, so a test
cannot inject through it -- instead the fakes are substituted for the CLASSES each
module constructs, leaving the dispatch, the argument filtering, the gates, the journal
and the read-back verification all running for real. Nothing here needs Zotero running;
the autouse fixture in `conftest.py` makes a real HTTP call raise.

    the name is enough -- and it is the only way in, because the MCP surface has no
    injection parameter by design." Both halves are now false. The verbs take a
    `WriteSession`, and `call_writes` takes one too, so the tests below pass
    `session=session` and nothing is rewritten from under the code.

    Two of those patches also used `raising=False`, which means a renamed module would
    have silently stopped being patched -- a test could believe it held a fake and be
    talking to a real client. Injection cannot fail that way: a missing argument is a
