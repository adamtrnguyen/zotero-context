"""PARITY WITH COOKJOHN -- the gate for unregistering its MCP server.

cookjohn's `zotero-plugin` MCP exposes 24 tools to an agent. Nine of them are WRITES that
duplicate the gated ones in `zotero_core.write`, with no precondition, no journal and no
read-back; those are the ones this suite exists to replace. The other fifteen are READS,
and for a long time they were the ONLY answer to "what is in collection X", "what type is
this item" and "search my library" -- which is why the server stayed registered long after
its write half was superseded.

This file asserts that every one of those fifteen now has a home here, or is on a short
explicit list of things deliberately not carried over. It exists so that unregistering
cookjohn is a checked step rather than a hopeful one: without it, the read gap reappears
silently and nobody notices until an agent cannot answer a question it used to answer.

⚠ The plugin is NOT uninstalled by any of this. `zotero_core.write` uses it as a write
TRANSPORT over :23121, and `importers/calibre2zotero` and `calibre-zotero-jump` open
their own connections to the same port. Unregistering removes 24 tools from an agent's
tool list; it changes nothing about the transport.
