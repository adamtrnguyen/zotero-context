"""`zotero_core.__all__` is the PUBLISHED API. This is the gate that makes moving cheap.

`zotero-core` is a distributed library, not an application, so it deviates from the
convention the rest of the estate follows: omni-rag's fifteen layer `__init__.py` files are
all zero bytes and nothing is ever re-exported. Here the top-level `__all__` is what
`omni-rag` and `youtube2zotero` import, and keeping it stable is precisely what turns "every
internal move is a breaking change" into "internal moves are free".

That trade only holds if something checks it, which nothing did.
