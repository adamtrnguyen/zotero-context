"""zotero-core: the ONE place that knows what a local Zotero library is.

Read and write, behind enforced internal layers:

    domain/       entities, values, policy          pure -- no driver imports
    read/         sqlite + bridge + BBT             "what is in the library"
    write/        gated verbs + two transports      "change it, recoverably"
    interfaces/   cli, read_mcp, write_mcp          the only layer that imports mcp

WHY ONE PACKAGE (merged 2026-08-19, was zotero-context + zotero-writes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The split was defensible and it was enforced -- `writes -> core, never the reverse`
had its own import-linter contract. What it could not survive was that the read half
was never finished. `core` shipped `items.py` and `duplicates.py` and exposed NEITHER
from its CLI or MCP surface, and never had collection or search queries at all. So an
agent asking "what is in collection X" had to go to a third-party plugin, and the
charter sentence -- "a second answer to what is in the library is the failure this
package exists to end" -- described a gap rather than a guarantee.

Two packages also meant two of everything that was really one thing: two pyprojects
agreeing on `mcp<2` and `ty==0.0.55` in duplicated comments, two lockfiles, and one
test suite that lived in `writes/` and reached `core` incidentally -- `core` had no
`tests/` directory and no `.importlinter` of its own.

The direction the split protected is now a LAYER, not a package boundary, and it is
still checked: see `.importlinter`, contract `layers`. Nothing was weakened by
merging; `domain` is a rule that could not previously be expressed at all.

WHAT THIS MODULE EXPORTS
------------------------
The READ surface only. `import zotero_core` must stay cheap and side-effect free:
the write verbs reach two HTTP transports and are an explicit opt-in --

    from zotero_core.application import create_item, trash_items

which also keeps the CRUD surface a deliberate act rather than something a caller
gets by accident.

# The three WRITE VERBS are published LAZILY, and the reason is a real contract failure
# rather than a preference. Importing `zotero_core.anything` executes THIS file first
# (Python imports ancestor packages), so a module-level `from zotero_core.application.services.verbs
# import ...` here makes every layer -- including `domain` -- depend on `write`. That is
# precisely what `interfaces above write above infrastructure above domain` forbids, and
# import-linter caught it: `infrastructure.service -> zotero_core -> write.verbs`.
#
# PEP 562 defers the import to first ATTRIBUTE ACCESS, so `from zotero_core import
# write_note` still works, `hasattr` still works, and no import-time edge exists for the
# contract to trip on. The two transports above stay eager because they are
# `infrastructure`, which this file is already allowed to import.
#
# This is the cost of keeping re-exports at all -- omni-rag's convention is "never", and
# this package deviates on purpose because `__all__` IS its published API.

#: The composition root, BOTH halves. Published because the verbs require a `WriteSession`
#: and `ZoteroContext` now requires eight ports, so a consumer cannot build either itself.
#: ⚠ `build_context` was NOT published at first, and that omission BROKE `arxiv-bulk`:
#: `ZoteroContext(zotero_db_path=...)` had been the documented way in, the read-side port
#: replaced that constructor, and the replacement was not on the public surface. Publishing
#: `ZoteroContext` as a NAME is not the same as publishing a way to construct one.
#: Lazy for the same reason as the verbs: it imports `interfaces`, which sits above
#: everything, and an eager import here would put that in every layer's import graph.

    # into modules that were about to move, which is how it broke earlier the same day.
