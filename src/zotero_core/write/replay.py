"""Reading the write journal, and replaying an inverse.

NAMED `replay`, NOT `undo`, and that is not cosmetic: `write/__init__` re-exports the
`undo` FUNCTION, which binds that name on the package and makes a module of the same name
permanently unreachable -- `import zotero_core.write.undo` silently hands back the
function, with an AttributeError on first use. The public verb keeps the good name; the
module takes a different one.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
-------------------
Ten verbs write a manifest containing the call that reverses them. NOTHING READ THEM.
`write_manifest` had no counterpart: no lister, no parser, no replay, not even a `glob`
of the journal directory anywhere in the package. The `undo_call` string in a result
envelope was advisory text a human retyped by hand -- and the manifest's own docstring
argues that "prose like 'restore it in the GUI' is not an undo; something a human can
paste is", which was true and still left the pasting to the human.

WHY NOT `eval`
--------------
`inverse` is a literal call string like

    add_items_to_collection('C4XFPWCD', ['SQQTHCIX'])

Replaying it means turning text into a call, and the lazy way to do that is `eval`. That
would execute arbitrary code out of a file in `/tmp` that any process can write -- in a
package whose entire premise is gating what reaches the library. Instead the string is
PARSED with `ast`, the callee must be a bare name on a whitelist of undo verbs, and every
argument must satisfy `ast.literal_eval`. Anything else is refused and reported, not run.

WHAT CANNOT BE UNDONE, AND WHY IT SAYS SO
-----------------------------------------
Not every manifest carries a replayable inverse, and the honest thing is to name the
reason rather than fail obscurely:

  no inverse recorded   `write_note(action="update")` deliberately does not capture the
                        previous body, and `update_metadata` records None when nothing
                        was overwritten -- cookjohn has no field-remove, so there is no
                        inverse to express.
  placeholder           `delete_collection`'s inverse is prose with a `<new key>` in it:
                        recreating a collection gives it a NEW key, so the second half of
                        the undo cannot be written before the first half runs.
  unknown verb          a manifest from an older or newer version of this package.

`REPLAYABLE` is deliberately a subset of the write surface: it holds the verbs that
reverse another verb, not every verb. `trash_items` is here because it reverses
`restore_items`; `delete_collection` is NOT, because undoing a deletion by deleting
something is never right.
