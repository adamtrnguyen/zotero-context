"""MCP JSON-RPC transport to the cookjohn zotero-mcp-plugin on :23121.

THIS FILE IS THE POINT OF THE PACKAGE. It is the third copy of this client, and it
exists so the first two can be deleted:

  * `importers/calibre2zotero/sync.py:139`  class Mcp
  * `calibre-zotero-jump/ui.py:24`          class _Mcp

They are near-identical -- same initialize handshake, same SSE-unwrapping hack,
same `tools/call` result flattening -- and they were copied rather than shared, so
they drifted where it mattered most: they disagree about how to tell whether a book
is already in Zotero. One scans Zotero's `extra` for `calibre-uuid:`, the other
trusts a `zotero` identifier on the Calibre side. Two answers to one question is
what a missing owner produces.

One of the two cannot be fixed by importing this. `calibre-zotero-jump` is a Calibre
plugin running inside Calibre's embedded Python, which cannot see a uv virtualenv --
its own comment says "stdlib-only; inline mirrors of importers/calibre2zotero". That
is why this module is stdlib-only too: `urllib` and `json`, nothing else. It cannot
be imported there today, but it can at least be VENDORED there verbatim instead of
rewritten, and the dedupe question now has one answer to vendor.

THE SSE UNWRAP, WHICH LOOKS LIKE A HACK AND IS NOT
--------------------------------------------------
The server may answer a plain POST with an `text/event-stream` body -- `event: ...`
then `data: {...}` lines -- rather than bare JSON, depending on the Accept header it
sees. Both hand-copied clients carry the same unwrap, which is the strongest
evidence available that it is load-bearing rather than cargo: two independent
call sites hit it. The last `data:` line is the result.

WHY NOT THE OFFICIAL MCP CLIENT LIBRARY
---------------------------------------
`mcp` is a real dependency with its own async runtime, and this package's whole
transport need is one POST with a two-line handshake. core deliberately keeps `mcp`
behind an optional extra for the same reason. Adding it as a hard dependency here
would put an async client in the import path of a Calibre plugin that cannot use it.
