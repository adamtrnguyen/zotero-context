"""HTTP transport to the zotero-linker plugin — the sanctioned mutator.

This module is deliberately dumb. It knows how to reach the plugin and how to
turn its replies into exceptions; it knows nothing about what a valid write is.
Every precondition lives in `writes.py`, so there is one place to read to find
out what is enforced.

WHY THE PLUGIN AND NOT SOMETHING ELSE
-------------------------------------
The four channels into local Zotero, from docs/DESIGN.md:

  * Local REST API `:23119/api` — GET-only, "Write access is not yet supported"
  * Connector API `:23119/connector/*` — create-only; cannot modify existing items
  * direct `zotero.sqlite` — forbidden read-write by ZoteroSuite's own rules
  * in-process plugin JS — the only channel with unrestricted local writes

So the plugin is not a preference, it is the only door. `linker/bootstrap.js`
v0.3.0 registers `trash-items` and `restore-items` on it and has had ZERO
consumers since it shipped; this package is the client it was missing.

READING ERRORS OUT OF urllib
----------------------------
The plugin signals refusal with a non-2xx status AND a JSON body
(`{"ok": false, "error": ...}` — see `fail()` in bootstrap.js). urllib raises
`HTTPError` on 4xx/5xx, and an HTTPError IS a response object, so the body has to
be read off the exception or the plugin's actual reason is discarded and replaced
with a bare "HTTP Error 404: Not Found".
