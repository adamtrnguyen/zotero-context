"""Collection CRUD. All of it rides cookjohn's MCP; the caller never sees that.

Collections are the one part of the surface where the plugin exposes a genuinely
dangerous option, and it is a keyword argument on an innocuous-sounding verb:

    delete_collection(collectionKey, deleteItems=True)

cookjohn's own description says "WARNING: This is a destructive operation... Set
deleteItems=true to also send items in the collection to trash." So one boolean turns
"delete this folder" into "trash everything filed in it". It is gated here, refused
without `force=True`, and the membership is journalled first -- because the inverse of
that cascade is a list of item keys nobody would otherwise have.

Deleting a collection is NOT deleting its items by default, which is worth stating
plainly: the items stay in the library, they just stop being filed there. That makes
the default form recoverable only in part -- the collection itself is gone from the
`collections` table and cannot be restored from the trash the way an item can, since
Zotero's trash holds items. So the manifest records the name, the parent, and every
member key, which together are enough to rebuild it by hand.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    There was no move. A caller did `add_items_to_collection` then
    `remove_items_from_collection` -- two calls, each with its own gates, only the
    second journalled, and NO rollback. If the remove failed the items were left in
    BOTH collections, silently, and the caller had a success envelope from the add to
    reassure them. (That is not hypothetical: this document's own author left an item in
    two collections that way while testing the surface.)

    WHAT MAKES IT SAFE
    ------------------
    Order is deliberate: ADD first, then remove. The intermediate state is "in both",
    which is recoverable and visible, rather than "in neither", which looks like the
    items vanished. If the remove fails, the add is undone and the library is exactly as
    it started -- reported as `rolled_back`, which is a DIFFERENT code from
    `partial_apply` because the two need different responses: rolled-back means try
    again, partial means go and look.

    Membership is checked BEFORE moving. Moving an item that is not in the source
    collection is a silent no-op through the two-call route -- the add succeeds, the
    remove removes nothing, and the result claims success. Here it refuses, unless
    `force`, in which case it files them into the target and says which were not in the
    source.
