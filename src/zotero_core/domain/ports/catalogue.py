"""The read the write path needs before it is allowed to write.

Every precondition a verb checks is a read — does the key resolve, is it already trashed,
what tags are there to be replaced, which base field does this item type map to. This
port is exactly that set and nothing else: six methods and two attributes, taken from
every `store.*` reference in the write layer rather than from `ZoteroItemStore`'s full
surface, which is larger and serves the read side too.

Narrower than the class that implements it, on purpose. A port copied from an
implementation is just the implementation with extra steps; this one states what the
application actually depends on, so widening it is a visible decision.

⚠ WIDENED 2026-08-20, and this is that visible decision. `pdf_attachments` and
`trashed_count` are read by the READ facade, not by any write gate. They are here rather
than in a second item port because two ports over one class, distinguished only by which
consumer happens to call them, is bookkeeping rather than design — and because `omni-rag`
already consumes `pdf_attachments` through this same store. Still eight methods against a
class with more.
