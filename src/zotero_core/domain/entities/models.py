"""Zotero nouns, as read out of zotero.sqlite.

All joins or projections rather than raw rows. None has a `from_bridge` — nothing here
comes off the wire; the bridge DTOs live next door in `gui.py`.

⚠ TWELVE OF THESE WERE DEFINED INSIDE THE SQL LAYER. `ItemState`, `Library`, `ItemHit`
and the rest sat in `read/items.py`, `read/libraries.py`, `read/search.py` and
`read/collections.py` — so the package's actual Zotero nouns were declared by the module
that queries for them, while `domain/entities.py` held only the six bridge DTOs that
model an HTTP response. That is what made `domain/` a shared-utilities bucket rather than
a domain: the entities were somewhere else.

Moving them costs consumers nothing because tests and `omni-rag` couple to these types
STRUCTURALLY — by attribute and dict key, never by import path — and the four public ones
(`ItemState`, `ItemStates`, `ZoteroAttachment`, `ZoteroAttachments`) still resolve from
`zotero_core` unchanged.
