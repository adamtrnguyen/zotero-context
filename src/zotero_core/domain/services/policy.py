"""Text policy: normalising a title, and scoring how well two strings match.

Pure. No sqlite, no network, no mcp -- enforced by the `domain-is-pure` contract, which
is the point of this layer existing: the normaliser lived in `read/duplicates.py` as a
private, and the search layer needed the same one. Two copies of a normaliser is how
'Hébert' stops matching 'Hebert' in one place and not the other.

WHY NOT rapidfuzz
-----------------
`calfuzz` (CalibreSuite) uses it and measures 97% recall against 69% for substring
matching. It is the better library. It is also a C extension, and this package has
`dependencies = []` on purpose -- `calibre-zotero-jump` vendors part of it into Calibre's
embedded Python, which cannot see a uv virtualenv. `difflib` is stdlib and gets most of
the way; see `fuzzy_score` for the algorithm and its measured behaviour.

    dropped every combining mark, so 'が' collapsed to 'か' and two different Japanese

    noted calibre-core's version does not have it. Since this normaliser now also backs
