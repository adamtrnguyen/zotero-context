"""Collection reads: the tree, membership, and the inverse.

WHY THIS DID NOT EXIST
----------------------
`zotero_core.read` owned every Zotero SQL query by charter and had NO collection queries
at all -- `grep parentCollectionID` over the package returned nothing, and the
`collections` table was joined in exactly one place, to turn an id into a display string
for a PDF's attachment row.

Collection WRITES were fully exposed the whole time (create, update, delete, file,
unfile). So an agent could create a collection and file items into it and then could not
read back what collections existed or what was in one. That asymmetry is why cookjohn's
third-party plugin stayed in the tool surface: it was the only answer to "what is in
collection X", which is precisely the "consumers duplicate Zotero SQL" outcome this
package exists to prevent.

TWO THINGS THAT BITE
--------------------
1. **Library scoping is not optional.** This machine has libraryIDs 1, 2, 4 and 5 --
   group libraries are real here, not hypothetical. An unscoped tree query silently
   mixes them, and the same collection NAME can exist in several. Every query below is
   scoped, matching `items.py`.
2. **A cycle makes collections VANISH; it does not hang.** This was worth getting
   right, because the intuitive fear is the wrong one. `parentCollectionID` is a
   SINGLE parent pointer, so a cycle (A's parent is B, B's parent is A) has no member
   with a NULL parent -- and the recursion is anchored on exactly that. The cycle is
   therefore unreachable from the anchor, the query terminates normally, and every
   collection inside the cycle is silently ABSENT from the tree.

   `MAX_DEPTH` is not a cycle guard, then; it bounds pathological DEPTH, and
   `CollectionTree.truncated` reports when it bit rather than quietly cutting the tree
   short. A test asserts the vanishing behaviour so it stays a known property instead
   of being rediscovered as "a collection disappeared".
