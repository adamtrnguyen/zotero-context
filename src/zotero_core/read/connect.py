"""Opening zotero.sqlite read-only, and saying which mode answered.

ONE opener for the whole read layer. This logic lived as `ZoteroItemStore._connect`,
and `duplicates.check_duplicate` already reached across to call it -- the package's only
cross-module private access. `collections` and `search` would have been the third and
fourth, so it is a module now rather than a private that everyone pretends not to touch.

WHY THE MODE IS RETURNED
------------------------
Zotero uses a ROLLBACK JOURNAL, not WAL. With the app running, a plain `mode=ro` read
intermittently loses to the writer and fails with "database is locked (5)" -- observed
live, not theorised. `immutable=1` always answers, but it answers from a POINT-IN-TIME
snapshot: it tells sqlite the file cannot change, so the journal is ignored.

Those two are not interchangeable, and the difference is invisible in the rows. A caller
checking whether a write landed needs to know it was told by a snapshot, so every read in
this layer carries `read_mode` out to its caller rather than quietly picking one.

    Defined HERE, in the module that raises it, rather than in `annotations.py` where it
    used to live. That location was an accident of history and it inverted the
    dependency: `connect` is the lowest read module and every other reader depends on
    it, so importing an exception upward from `annotations` made a cycle the moment
    `annotations` needed the shared opener.

    `annotations.ZoteroAnnotationError` is kept as an alias -- the name is exported and
    caught in several places, and it is not worth breaking. It was always a misnomer:
    it is raised for "cannot open the database", which has nothing to do with
