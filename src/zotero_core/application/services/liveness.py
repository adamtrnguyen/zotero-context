"""The liveness gate. One probe, three distinguishable failures.

THE PRECONDITION THAT INVERTS
-----------------------------
calibre-core's first gate is "the Calibre GUI must be CLOSED" -- `calibredb`
corrupts state if it writes underneath a running GUI. Zotero is the exact opposite:
every write channel is code executing INSIDE the application, so a closed Zotero is
not a safe state, it is no channel at all.

WHY THREE FAILURES AND NOT ONE BOOLEAN
--------------------------------------
The surface spans two plugins on two ports, and they fail independently. Collapsing
that into "Zotero is not available" would send someone to start an application that
is already running. So the probe walks a hierarchy:

    :23119/            -- Zotero's own built-in server. Present whenever Zotero runs,
                          with no plugin involved, which makes it the authoritative
                          "is the application up" signal.
    :23119/zotero-linker/ping   -- the linker plugin (trash, restore, linked files)
    :23121/mcp                  -- the cookjohn plugin (items, metadata, collections)

Connection refused at :23119 means the app is down (`zotero_not_running`). :23119
answering while a plugin path does not means the app is up and that ONE plugin is
missing (`linker_not_installed` / `cookjohn_not_installed`), which is a different
job to fix.

Each operation declares the transports it actually needs, so a metadata write is
not blocked by a missing linker and a trash is not blocked by a missing cookjohn.
