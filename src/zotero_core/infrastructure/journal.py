"""Recording what a write is about to change, so it can be undone.

WHY THIS IS A MANIFEST AND NOT A DATABASE COPY
----------------------------------------------
calibre-core copies metadata.db before every write because a DB rollback is the only
undo that exists there. Neither half of that holds for Zotero:

  * `zotero.sqlite` is 329 MB (measured 2026-08-13), and Zotero already keeps five
    rotating daily copies of it beside the original (`zotero.sqlite.bak` .. `.4.bak`).
    Copying it per call spends ~330 MB duplicating what already exists.
  * restoring such a copy is not an undo anyone can safely take: it requires closing
    Zotero and reverts every unrelated change since the copy was made. Taken while
    Zotero runs it also needs its `-journal` alongside to be coherent at all.

So "back up before mutating" is honoured per-operation, by recording the state the
write is about to overwrite plus the call that reverses it. `copy_database` is still
here for a caller who wants the 329 MB snapshot, with the cost stated.

WHICH OPERATIONS GET A MANIFEST, AND WHY NOT ALL OF THEM
-------------------------------------------------------
Only the ones that overwrite or remove something. A `create` has no prior state --
journalling "nothing was here" would be filing noise, and it invites the habit of
skimming manifests. What gets one:

    trash / restore          the trash flag
    metadata update          the previous value of every field being written
    tag set / creator replace  the entire previous list (these REPLACE, not merge)
    collection delete/rename   the name, parent, and membership
    remove items from collection  the membership being removed

Creates and pure additions (`add_tags`, `add_items_to_collection`) do not, because
the inverse of an addition is a removal the caller can already express.

    reached `os.makedirs(None)` and raised TypeError AFTER the manifest was written and

    NO test calls `write_manifest` or `copy_database` directly — every path goes through

    adapts are different things), but it is not earning a testability argument, so that
    argument is removed rather than left standing as a reason nobody checked.

    Satisfies the port STRUCTURALLY -- it does not import it. That is what keeps the
