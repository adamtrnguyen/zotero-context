"""Read-only item-state lookups: existence, trash state, type, parents, children.

Exists to serve the WRITE gate in `application/services/` without putting any SQL
there. Every precondition a write needs is a read -- does this key resolve, is it
already in the trash, what type is it, what hangs off it -- and ZoteroSuite's rule
is that consumers do not duplicate Zotero SQL (README, "Rules of the road"). So
the reads live here, in the canonical read layer, and `zotero_core.application` reaches
Zotero through exactly one channel: the linker plugin's HTTP endpoint.

core stays READ-ONLY. Nothing here opens the database read-write.

WHICH READ MODE SERVED THE ANSWER
---------------------------------
It is reported rather than hidden, because the two modes do not answer the same
question. `mode=ro` is the honest read: it respects locking and plays back a hot
rollback journal. But Zotero holds the database locked while it runs, and the
write path REQUIRES Zotero to be running (that precondition inverts relative to
Calibre, which requires its GUI closed) -- so in normal operation `mode=ro` raises
and the `immutable=1` fallback is what actually serves the row. Measured
2026-08-13 against the live 329 MB database with Zotero 9.0.6 up:

    mode=ro        FAIL OperationalError: database is locked
    immutable=1    OK  deletedItems=277 items=3405

`immutable=1` tells SQLite the file cannot change, so it skips locking and skips
hot-journal playback: a point-in-time view of the main file's pages. That is fine
for a precondition -- a stale read blocks a write that would have been fine, which
is the safe direction -- but it is NOT authority for "the write did not land".
`ItemStates.read_mode` travels with the answer so the write path can tell a
verified result from a snapshot that may simply be behind.

LIBRARY SCOPE
-------------
Every lookup is scoped to ONE library, default the user library (libraryID 1,
confirmed `type='user'` in `libraries`). This matches
`Zotero.Items.getByLibraryAndKey(Zotero.Libraries.userLibraryID, key)`, which is
how `linker/bootstrap.js` resolves the same keys. Unscoped lookups would make the
precheck and the plugin disagree about which keys exist -- this database has six
group libraries as well.

        This is the enumeration a corpus builder needs: `(key, path, title, collection)` per PDF.
        It lives here because ZoteroSuite's rule is that consumers do not duplicate Zotero SQL
        (README, "Rules of the road") -- omni-rag carried its own copy of this query in a script
        called `prototype_zotero.py` for months, which is how `omnirag papers ingest` ended up
        existing with no enumerator behind it at all.

        The PATH is resolved by globbing the storage folder, NOT by parsing `itemAttachments.path`.
        The stored value is `storage:<filename>`, and the filename on disk can diverge from it;
        the folder name is the attachment key and is authoritative. An attachment whose folder
        holds no PDF is skipped rather than returned with a path that does not exist.

        `title` falls back to the file's stem when the parent has none, and is **never
        truncated** -- a truncated title silently merges distinct works under one label, which
        is a real defect class in a consumer keying rows on a display string.

        ⚠ Scoped to `library_id` like every other read here, so a group library's PDFs are not
        enumerated into a user-library corpus.

        ⚠ A paper in SEVERAL collections reports the first by NAME, and the `ORDER BY` is
        load-bearing. A bare `LIMIT 1` returns whichever row the query plan reaches first, so the
        answer is arbitrary and can change under a schema or plan change with no data change at
        all -- and a consumer keying a filter on it (omnirag's `--field`) would see a paper
        silently move between filters on re-ingest. Measured against the live library: three
        collections present in omni-rag's index (`Cranberry Lab`, `Energy Lab`, `ENGL 1105`) are
        no longer what the unordered pick returns for those papers. Alphabetical is arbitrary too,
        but it is STABLE, which is the property that matters.

        ⚠ Returns duplicates as-is. Zotero legitimately holds the same paper under two attachment
        keys, and which copy to keep is the CONSUMER's policy (title, date, file size), not a read
        layer's. Dedupe downstream.

        ⚠ Excludes an attachment in the trash, but NOT one whose PARENT is trashed -- matching the
        query this replaced, so the enumeration does not change under consumers mid-migration.
        Tightening it to the parent is a deliberate change, with a re-ingest behind it.
