"""Which libraries exist. The user library, and any groups.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
----------------------
Every other query in this layer is SCOPED to one library, defaulting to the user's --
`USER_LIBRARY_ID = 1` -- because an unscoped query silently mixes a group's collections
and items into personal counts. That default is right, and it is also invisible: with no
way to list libraries, a caller cannot tell "you have nothing" from "you are looking in
the wrong library".

This is not hypothetical here. Measured 2026-08-19: seven libraries, six of them groups,
four of those non-empty -- 109 items and 10 collections outside the user library, all old
coursework (ENGE1215_A4, D7 resources, A4_U2 Project, companionbot3000).

`item_count` counts LIVE items, matching every other count in this layer, and counts
every item type rather than only top-level ones -- it is a "is there anything in here"
signal for choosing a library, not a catalogue figure.
