"""The stdio MCP server both adapters run. ONE implementation.

WHAT WAS DUPLICATED, AND WHY IT SURVIVED THE FIRST DEDUP
--------------------------------------------------------
`interfaces/tool_spec.py` exists because the per-tool declaration and dispatch were written
twice; its docstring makes exactly that argument. The BOOTSTRAP around them was left behind
and stayed duplicated: `read_mcp.main()` and `write_mcp.main()` were ~54 lines each, of which
roughly half was identical line for line — the `mcp` import guard, `Server(SERVER_NAME)`, the
entire `@server.list_tools()` handler, and the `stdio_server()` + `InitializationOptions`
block.

The genuinely different part is what happens to ONE tool call, which is why that is the
parameter: the read adapter turns any exception into `{ok, code, error}`, while the write
adapter has a `WriteBlocked` branch whose `detail` is the whole point of the adapter existing.
Passing a callback keeps that difference where it belongs and removes the rest.

WHY `mcp` IS IMPORTED IN THE FUNCTION BODY
------------------------------------------
`dependencies = []`. Both adapters must be IMPORTABLE without the `mcp` extra, so `TOOLS` can
be inspected and the entry point can reach its own error message. Two AST tests assert the
adapters have no module-scope `mcp` import; this module is subject to the same rule and keeps
the import inside `run_stdio` for the same reason.
