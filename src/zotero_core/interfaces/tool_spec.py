"""One tool declaration, shared by both MCP adapters.

WHY IT IS SHARED
----------------
`_ToolSpec` existed twice, byte-identical apart from a docstring and one extra field, and
so did `as_tool_schema()` and the dispatch that consumes it. Both adapters exist BECAUSE of
this shape -- each replaced a three-place-per-tool change (a `types.Tool(...)` literal, an
`if name == ...` branch, and hand-written argument coercion) with one table entry. Declaring
the table's row type twice reintroduced, one level up, exactly the duplication the table was
built to remove.

WHY IT LIVES IN `interfaces/` AND NOT `domain/`
----------------------------------------------
It is an MCP concern, not a Zotero one: `properties` is JSON Schema and `as_tool_schema()`
emits it. The domain does not know what a tool is. It stays out of `domain/` for the same
reason the `mcp-only-in-the-adapter` contract exists -- and note this module itself imports
no `mcp`, so that contract is unaffected either way.

`ToolSpec` (read) and `WriteToolSpec` (write) rather than one class with an optional field:
a read tool has no transport, and giving it one defaulted to `"cookjohn"` would state
something false about every one of the twenty.
